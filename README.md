# cooking-recipes-js

Simple React Cooking Recipes Application
Front-end only (with browser database)
Purpose: learning and show my coding skills
Language: portuguese-BR

The idea emerged from the need that I have when I'm cooking at home.
When I try some recipes that I got on Internet I use to customize some ingredients and methods.
Then I want to store these customized recipes in some place.
Next time I'll cook one of these recipes, I can check what I've done last time and if needed, edit, improve and store again.

-Default React/JavaScript structure created by Vite
-Styling: React-strap and Scss
-Language: JavaScript
-Database: browser IndexedDB with Dexie (data is stored on client browser storage)

For future, this app will be the basis for another one, with back-end and feature improvements.
