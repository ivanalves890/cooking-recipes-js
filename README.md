# Cooking Recipes JS

## Simple Cooking Recipes React Application

Front-end only (with browser database)

Language: portuguese-BR

### Purpose

Learning and show my coding skills

### Idea

The idea emerged from the need that I have when I'm cooking at home.  
When I try some recipes that I got on Internet I use to customize some ingredients and methods.  
Then I want to store these customized recipes in some place.  
Next time I'll cook one of these recipes, I can check what I've done last time and if needed, edit, improve and store again.

### Structure

- Default React/JavaScript structure created by Vite

- Styling: React-strap and Scss

- Language: JavaScript

- Database: browser IndexedDB with Dexie (data is stored on client browser storage)

For future, this app will be the basis for another one, with back-end and feature improvements.
